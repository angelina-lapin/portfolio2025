# Angelina Lapin – Portfolio

A clean, responsive, single-page portfolio website built with **Vanilla JS**, **HTML/CSS**, and a touch of **Bootstrap**. It showcases my latest projects, shares a bit about me, and provides ways to get in touch.

## Reflections

This project helped me practice:

- Writing modular, maintainable CSS and JavaScript without frameworks
- Organizing and presenting content in a user-centered way
- Making fully responsive layouts
- Creating custom animations and scroll-based behaviors

---

## How to Use Locally

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angelina-lapin/portfolio
   ```

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no build tools required!)  
   Or use Live Server extension in VS Code.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add animations with IntersectionObserver
- Enhance accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Consider migrating to React for advanced interactivity
